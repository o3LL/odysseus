# SearXNG image trust correction

SearXNG has independent system and Python certificate stores. Updating Odysseus's Python environment does not update this sidecar. The pinned SearXNG image includes certificate authorities listed in the public eMudhra incident inventory. `docker/searxng/Dockerfile` derives a corrected image from the same immutable application base, without downloading dependencies or changing the SearXNG version.

The build removes the 21 known incident CA certificates by SHA-256 fingerprint from system CA source files and certifi, regenerates the system PEM bundle and hashed CA directory, and checks the generated stores. Only certificates present in the base are removed: the inspected amd64 image loses two system roots and one certifi root. Unaffected certificates remain. The image's existing certifi package version metadata is unchanged; this is an image-owned trust-content correction rather than a package upgrade.

The runtime is Void Linux with its package manager removed. Do not substitute Alpine, Debian or XBPS package-install commands. Removing affected source certificates is necessary because the upstream root entrypoint runs `update-ca-certificates` again at startup.

## Build and validate

Run these commands from the repository root on a Docker host. The build context allowlist excludes credentials and unrelated application files. The repair requires no build-step network; pulling the pinned base still needs registry access.

```sh
# Reproduce the affected upstream behavior with offline public chain fixtures.
docker build --network=none --target baseline-validation -f docker/searxng/Dockerfile .

# Check corrected trust and actual upstream entrypoint/loopback health.
docker build --network=none --target validation -f docker/searxng/Dockerfile .

# Also exercise verified HTTPS through SearXNG's own curl client and a real search.
# Requires outbound networking and working upstream engines.
docker build --target live-validation -f docker/searxng/Dockerfile .

# Build the runtime image and select it through the opt-in Compose overlay.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/searxng/compose.yml build searxng
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/searxng/compose.yml up -d --no-deps searxng
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/searxng/compose.yml ps searxng
```

The overlay retains the base service's settings migration, persistent configuration, healthcheck, ports and capability limits. All Compose commands managing this local image must include the overlay; using only the base file selects its original image. Validation fixtures and validation scripts are excluded from the runtime stage.

The offline checks use twelve public incident chains with a frozen verification time, hostname verification and affected positive controls. They independently exercise the system PEM, system hashed directory and certifi bundle. The unpatched baseline must accept 12/12, 12/12 and 6/12 respectively; the corrected image must reject all twelve in every store. The startup check rechecks system trust after the upstream entrypoint regenerates it. Live validation requires an ordinary verified HTTPS request and nonempty SearXNG JSON search results; network and engine availability can cause that optional target to fail.

## Scope and rollout

Validate each target architecture on a native builder or an explicitly configured emulation builder. An amd64 success does not establish arm64 support. This patch preserves the upstream default identity and entrypoint; it does not alter host trust, existing running containers or operator-mounted/custom trust stores. Operators must inspect those overrides separately. Removing AAA Certificate Services can also affect unrelated legacy certificate chains anchored solely there; test configured engines and any private integrations before rollout.

After architecture validation and independent review, publish an approved multi-architecture runtime image, record its immutable digest, and update the base and standalone GPU Compose pins together. The opt-in overlay permits local validation before a published reference exists. Recreate affected services after selecting the replacement. Keep the broader incident remediation tracker open for deployment and other runtime work.

## Public fixture provenance

Fingerprint inventory: <https://emudhra.we-have-a-problem.com/roots.json> and <https://emudhra.we-have-a-problem.com/impacted-intermediates.json>. The cross-signed issuer and chain fixtures come from <https://emudhra.we-have-a-problem.com/chains.zip> (archive SHA-256 `8a2edc81b6c51e3ad27d45ca1e441ec84c961e2dee0fc547f2a02c0f74315f95`). Fixtures contain public certificates only. Each fixture certificate's fingerprint is verified before chain checks.
